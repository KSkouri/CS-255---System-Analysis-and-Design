# CS-255---System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client in this project was DriverPass, who wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. They wanted a web-based system that would allow students to manage appointments and take classes and tests based upon the most up-to-date information directly from the DMV.

# What did you do particularly well?
I felt I did well at parsing through the interview and identifying the requirements requested by the client and transferring them to the Business Requirement Document.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One part I would choose to revise is my Gantt Chart. I feel that the lay out of the days could be improved so that it’s not so large and easier to take in/read.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by studying the DriverPass interview and taking note of all their different requests for the system. Fulfilling the user’s needs is paramount for designing an effective system that is successfully implemented.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Designing software requires a clear and complete understanding of the client’s needs and wants in a system.  It is important to create documentation detailing these requirements and creating a clear understanding of the system through various diagrams, representing different aspects of the system.
